# Working Session Summary — 2026-05-04 (evening)

## Starting Point

Session resumed from 2026-05-04 afternoon. MVP 3 was fully planned (13 tasks), all docs updated, committed in `f9a6a57`. This session focused on implementing all 12 code tasks for MVP 3.

## What We Did

Implemented all 12 code tasks for MVP 3. Committed as `9703767`, docs updated in `ca0724c`.

### Task 1 — Fix `rawMarkdown` bug ✅
- Added `rawMarkdown: string` field to `VideoProjectEntity`, stored in constructor and `toJSON()`
- Added defensive fallback `if (!entity.rawMarkdown) entity.rawMarkdown = ''` in `fromJSON()` for backward compatibility with old project files
- Fixed `PipelineOrchestrator.run()`: changed `rawMarkdown: entity.toJSON().createdAt` → `rawMarkdown: entity.rawMarkdown`
- Added `rawMarkdown: z.string()` to `VideoProjectSchema` in `packages/shared`

### Task 2 — Download images locally for Remotion ✅
- Added `imagesDir` in `run()` alongside `ttsDir`
- Added `downloadImages(partStates, imagesDir)` method — downloads each image to `workDir/images/part-{partIdx}-{imgIdx}.{ext}` using `axios`
- `guessExtension(url)` helper extracts extension from URL path
- `buildCompositionsData` now uses `img.localPath ?? img.url` (prefers local path)
- Failed downloads log a warning and fall back to remote URL — pipeline continues

### Task 3 — Fix FFmpeg path quoting on Windows ✅
- `postProcessVideo()`: replaced string interpolation `execAsync('ffmpeg ... "${path}"')` with `execFileAsync('ffmpeg', [args...])` — array args, no shell interpolation
- `measureDurations()`: same fix for `ffprobe` — `execFileAsync('ffprobe', ['-v','error','-show_entries',...])`
- Removed unused `spawn` import; kept `exec` for `spawnRemotionServer` and `checkQSVSupport`

### Task 4 — Pass voice parameter to Edge-TTS ✅
- `MsEdgeTTS.toFile()` doesn't accept a `voice` option — the voice is set via `setMetadata()`
- Added import of `OUTPUT_FORMAT` enum
- Before `toFile()`, now calls: `await this.tts.setMetadata(voiceName, OUTPUT_FORMAT.AUDIO_24KHZ_48KBITRATE_MONO_MP3)`

### Task 5 — VideoPlayer shown after page refresh ✅
- Changed `{isComplete && job?.outputPath && ...}` → `{isComplete && (job?.outputPath ?? project.outputPath) && ...}`
- Refresh a completed project page → VideoPlayer now renders

### Task 6 — Gate Render button on health status ✅
- Added `disabled={isStarting || !allHealthy}` to "Render Video" button
- Added `title` tooltip: "Check Readiness first — some services are unavailable"
- Added `disabled:cursor-not-allowed` Tailwind class

### Task 7 — Persist job progress during execution ✅
- Added `persistJobProgress(jobId, step, progress)` private method in `RenderService`
- `sendProgress()` callback now calls `persistJobProgress()` on every SSE event
- `jobEntity.setStep(step, progress)` called and saved to disk

### Task 8 — Cleanup temp workDir after pipeline ✅
- Wrapped entire pipeline in try/finally
- `finally` block: `killAllProcesses()` then `await this.cleanupWorkDir(workDir)`
- `cleanupWorkDir()` uses `fs.rm(workDir, { recursive: true, force: true })` with warning on error

### Task 9 — Kill child processes on abort ✅
- Added `private activeProcesses: ChildProcess[] = []` field
- `spawnRemotionServer()` pushes the server process to `activeProcesses`
- `killAllProcesses()` iterates and kills all tracked processes
- Abort signal listener calls `killAllProcesses()`
- After Remotion render completes, server is removed from `activeProcesses`

### Task 10 — Inline video playback ✅
- Replaced placeholder div with `<video controls src={downloadUrl} class="w-full h-full">`
- Kept download button below

### Task 11 — SSE reconnection with exponential backoff ✅
- Added `retryCountRef` and `retryTimerRef` refs
- `onerror`: if retryCount < 5, schedules reconnect with `delay = 1000 * 2^retryCount` (1s→2s→4s→8s→16s)
- `onopen`: resets `retryCountRef` to 0
- Cleanup clears timer on disconnect

### Task 12 — Per-part error display ✅
- `useSSE` now tracks `partErrors: Record<number, string>` in state
- SSE `type: 'error'` with `partIndex` updates `partErrors`
- `onError` callback now accepts `(message, partIndex?)`
- `RenderProgress` accepts `partErrors?: Record<number, string>` prop
- Part cards in grid show error message below the status icon

### Test Updates
- `VideoProjectEntity.test.ts`: added `rawMarkdown` to `toJSON()` test, `fromJSON()` data, and constructor call
- `ProjectController.test.ts`: added `rawMarkdown` to `makeVideoProject()` fixture
- `render.test.ts`: added `rawMarkdown` to entity constructor
- All 257 tests still passing

## How to Resume

1. Start servers: `pnpm dev:api` + `pnpm dev:web`
2. Voicebox at `localhost:8000`, FFmpeg in PATH
3. **Remaining: Task 13 — Smoke test (UAT C.1)**: Create project with 2 parts (valid keywords), render, verify all steps, video plays inline, persists after refresh
4. test.md: Unit tests A.1–A.6 and SIT tests B.1–B.4 still need to be written (test plan in test.md, implementation is done)
5. UAT scenarios C.2–C.7 also still need to be executed by user

## Session / Resumption Notes (continued)

### UAT Results from Prior Session

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| UAT 3.2 | PASS ✅ | FFmpeg fix worked. All binaries show green. |

---

## Starting Point

Session resumed from 2026-05-03. Previous session had fixed dotenv loading and REMOTION_CONCURRENCY empty-string crash. This session focused on UAT 3.2 (health check system) which surfaced FFmpeg/FFprobe binary detection issues.

## What We Did

### Bug Fix: FFmpeg/FFprobe Binary Check — "Command failed:..." Error

**Root cause (symptom):** The health check on `/api/health/detailed` showed FFmpeg and FFprobe as unavailable with raw Windows CLI errors: `'ffmpeg' is not recognized as an internal or external command`. Even after the user installed FFmpeg to `C:\Users\Raw\Downloads\Compressed\ffmpeg\bin\` and added it to the system PATH via PowerShell, the health check still failed.

**Root cause (code):** `checkBinary()` called bare `execAsync(`${name} ${args.join(' ')}`, ...)` (e.g., `ffmpeg -version`). This depends on the binary being in the shell's PATH. Node.js `exec()` inherits PATH from the parent process — but when Claude Code runs inside Git Bash, it inherits the bash session's PATH, not the Windows system PATH that PowerShell updated.

**Fix:** `checkBinary()` now resolves the full binary path via `where.exe ${name}` before executing:

```ts
const wherePath = await execAsync(`where.exe ${name}`, { timeout: 5000 })
  .then(r => r.stdout.trim().split('\n')[0].trim())
  .catch(() => null);
const binary = wherePath ?? name;
const { stdout } = await execAsync(`"${binary}" ${args.join(' ')}`, { timeout: 5000 });
```

`where.exe` resolves binaries against the Windows system PATH registry, which is the authoritative source. Quoting the full path also protects against paths with spaces.

Error message also cleaned: strips "Command failed: ..." prefix, strips Windows CLI noise (`'...' is not recognized...operable program or batch file.`), falls back to a friendly hint when the raw message is empty.

### Bug Fix: Media Provider `isAvailable()` Swallowed Errors

`PixabayProvider`, `PexelsProvider`, and `UnsplashProvider` wrapped their HTTP health-check calls in `try/catch` and returned `false` on any error. This meant a configured-but-unavailable provider (e.g., invalid API key returning HTTP 403) looked identical to an unconfigured one.

**Fix:** `isAvailable()` now throws on non-200 status instead of swallowing errors:

```ts
const response = await axios.get(...);
if (response.status !== 200) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}`);
return true;
```

`HealthCheckService` also updated to read API keys from `SettingsService` (persisted store) rather than the DI container's provider list, ensuring consistency between what the Settings page shows and what the health check tests.

### UX Fix: SettingsPage "Test" Button Feedback

The "Test" button for image providers on the Settings page showed only a spinner while testing. After the test completed, there was no visible confirmation of success or failure.

**Fix:** Added `testFeedback` state to track per-provider results. After testing:
- Success → green `CheckCircle` icon shown for 5 seconds
- Failure → red inline error message with the error text shown for 5 seconds

```

## How to Resume

1. Start servers: `pnpm dev:api` + `pnpm dev:web`
2. FFmpeg is installed at `C:\Users\Raw\Downloads\Compressed\ffmpeg\bin\` — health check should show green
3. Voicebox must be running at `http://localhost:8000` for its health check to show green
4. Remaining UAT: 3.1 (settings), 3.3 (pipeline abort), 3.4 (render cancel), 3.5 (process log), 3.6 (template)
5. MVP 3 defined: 13 tasks (6 critical path, 3 reliability, 3 UX polish, 1 smoke test). See CLAUDE.md for full task list. test.md updated with unit/SIT/UAT cases for MVP 3.

## MVP 3 Planning Session (2026-05-04, continued)

After committing the FFmpeg fix (`45cb292`), the MVP 3 scope was defined. Full codebase exploration (3 agents) revealed these key findings:

### Critical gaps blocking end-to-end video render
1. `rawMarkdown` bug — PipelineOrchestrator sets `rawMarkdown: entity.createdAt` instead of actual markdown text
2. Images are remote URLs — `MediaAsset` has no local paths; Remotion can't reliably fetch remote images in headless Chromium; thumbnail URLs used (wrong resolution)
3. FFmpeg path quoting — `execAsync('ffmpeg "${path}"')` breaks on Windows paths with spaces
4. Edge-TTS ignores voice — `MsEdgeTTS.toFile()` never receives the voice parameter
5. VideoPlayer hidden after refresh — `job?.outputPath` guard fails, `project.outputPath` ignored
6. Render button not gated — always enabled regardless of health status

### Reliability gaps
7. Job entity never updated during execution — `setStep()` never called
8. Temp workDir never cleaned — disk space leak after every render
9. Abort doesn't kill child processes — FFmpeg/Remotion keep running after cancel

### UX gaps
10. No inline video playback — `<video>` tag missing, only download link
11. No SSE reconnection — EventSource onerror closes without retry
12. Per-part errors not visible in grid — log scroll only

### Files that need changes for MVP 3
- `apps/api/src/application/services/PipelineOrchestrator.ts` — tasks 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- `apps/api/src/domain/entities/VideoProjectEntity.ts` — task 1
- `apps/api/src/application/services/RenderService.ts` — tasks 7, 9
- `apps/api/src/infrastructure/tts-engines/EdgeTTSEngine.ts` — task 4
- `apps/api/src/infrastructure/services/ProjectService.ts` — task 1
- `apps/web/src/pages/ProjectPage.tsx` — tasks 5, 6, 12
- `apps/web/src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx` — task 10
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useSSE.ts` — task 11
- `apps/web/src/components/RenderProgress.tsx` — task 12

## Starting Point

Session resumed from 2026-05-02's session. Previous session had fixed the web API test mocks and verified all 257 tests passing. Committed in `e61a3d2`. This session focused on UAT setup and a Voicebox health check investigation.

## What We Did

### Bug Fix: dotenv Loading from Wrong Directory (session 2026-05-02)

**Root cause:** `dotenv.config()` resolved `.env` relative to `process.cwd()`, which was `apps/api/` during development. Since `.env` lives at the project root, dotenv couldn't find it and all env vars fell back to Zod defaults. This caused `VOICEBOX_URL` to default to `http://127.0.0.1:17493` instead of reading from `.env`.

**Fix:** `EnvConfig.ts` now explicitly passes the root `.env` path to dotenv:
```ts
dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url), '../../../../../../.env') });
```
6 levels up from `apps/api/src/infrastructure/config/` lands at the project root.

### Bug Fix: REMOTION_CONCURRENCY Crash (session 2026-05-02)

**Root cause:** `.env` had `REMOTION_CONCURRENCY=` (empty string). `z.coerce.number()` converts `""` to `NaN`, which fails `min(1)`.

**Fix:** Added `z.preprocess()` to convert empty strings to `undefined`:
```ts
REMOTION_CONCURRENCY: z.preprocess(v => v === '' ? undefined : v, z.coerce.number().int().min(1).max(8).optional()),
```

### Investigation: Voicebox Health Check "Cannot Reach"

During UAT, the health check showed "Cannot reach Voicebox at http://127.0.0.1:17493" even with Voicebox running. Verified that:
- `.env` had correct `VOICEBOX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- After dotenv fix, API now correctly reports `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Voicebox at `localhost:8000` was not actually running — confirmed with `curl http://localhost:8000/profiles` (connection refused)
- Health check is **working correctly** — it reports unavailable because Voicebox wasn't started

**Key finding:** Voicebox must be started at `localhost:8000` before clicking the refresh button, or the health check will show "unavailable".

### Remotion Studio Breaking Change

`pnpm dev` (all workspaces) fails because `remotion.config.ts` uses `import { defineConfig } from 'remotion'`, which is no longer exported in remotion 4.0.454. This crashes the entire parallel run, killing API and web servers.

**Workaround:** Run API and web separately:
```bash
pnpm dev:api   # API on port 3001
pnpm dev:web   # Web on port 5173
```

### Commits

```
f712db5 fix: load .env from project root + handle empty REMOTION_CONCURRENCY
e61a3d2 fix: align TemplateEditor, health/settings/template APIs to use shared axios client

  apps/api/src/infrastructure/config/EnvConfig.ts   — dotenv path fix + REMOTION_CONCURRENCY preprocess
  apps/web/src/api/healthApi.test.ts                — mock ./client instead of axios
  apps/web/src/api/settingsApi.test.ts             — mock ./client instead of axios
  apps/web/src/api/templateApi.test.ts             — mock ./client instead of axios
  CLAUDE.md                                        — session notes updated
```

## How to Resume

1. Ensure Voicebox is running at `http://localhost:8000` before testing health checks
2. Start servers: `pnpm dev:api` + `pnpm dev:web` (do NOT use `pnpm dev` — Remotion Studio will crash it)
3. Run tests: `cd apps/api && pnpm test && pnpm test:uat && cd ../web && pnpm test`
4. Check `test.md` for remaining UAT scenarios (3.1–3.6, all pending)
5. Remotion Studio fix is pending — `defineConfig` breaking change in remotion 4.0.454

# Working Session Summary — 2026-05-02

## Starting Point

Session resumed from 2026-05-01's session. Previous session had written 257 tests (210 unit + 32 SIT + 15 web) for MVP 2 features. All code committed in `e61a3d2`. Two untracked files: `test.md` (UAT plan) and `working-session.md`.

## What We Did

### Bug Fix: Web API Tests Broken

The 3 web API test files (`healthApi.test.ts`, `settingsApi.test.ts`, `templateApi.test.ts`) were failing with:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'interceptors')
  at src/api/client.ts:8
```

**Root cause:** `client.ts` calls `axios.create()` at module load time. The tests called `vi.mock('axios')` after importing, so the mock wasn't active when `client.ts` initialized.

**Fix:** Changed all 3 test files to mock `./client` directly instead of `axios`:
```ts
// BEFORE (broken):
vi.mock('axios');
const mockedAxios = axios as unknown as { ... };

// AFTER (working):
vi.mock('./client', () => ({ api: { get: vi.fn(), post: vi.fn() } }));
import { api } from './client';
```

All 257 tests now passing.

### Test Results

```bash
cd apps/api && pnpm test     # 210 unit tests ✅
cd apps/api && pnpm test:uat # 32 SIT tests ✅
cd apps/web && pnpm test     # 15 web tests ✅
```

## Files Modified

```
MODIFIED (fix: mock ./client instead of axios):
  apps/web/src/api/healthApi.test.ts
  apps/web/src/api/settingsApi.test.ts
  apps/web/src/api/templateApi.test.ts
```

## How to Resume

1. Run `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to start all apps
2. Run test suite: `cd apps/api && pnpm test && pnpm test:uat && cd ../web && pnpm test`
3. Check `working-session.md` and `test.md` for UAT section — 6 manual test scenarios remain unexecuted
4. Web API tests use `vi.mock('./client')` pattern — remember not to mock `axios` directly when `client.ts` is in the import chain
